        <p>
          The intent of this project is to <strong>educate</strong> developers
          and anyone interested in web accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          A collection of inaccessible components demonstrates{" "}
          <strong>common accessibility and usability issues</strong> developers
          create (mostly unintentionally) when building websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          By realizing the impact of the issues, developers can understand{" "}
          <strong>what kind of barriers are various users facing</strong> so
          they can start remediating the issues, and learn how to create more
          accessible components.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many patterns and ways how to make certain components
          accessible, including various options and features components can
          have. There might be multiple ways to deal with certain issues, and
          rather than covering all of the possible approaches, this project
          focuses on{" "}
          <strong>
            demonstrating the issues and showing one way of fixing them
          </strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, there are multiple ways how to write HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, and those used here are not aiming to be cutting-edge,
          best performing, or simply the best. The setup and design are simple,
          allowing focus on accessibility and usability.
        </p>

          Below is a list of inaccessible components including the description
          of their accessibility and usability issues, additional
          considerations, and also the accessible version of the component for
          comparison.
